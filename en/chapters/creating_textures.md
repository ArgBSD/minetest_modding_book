## About MS Paint

You need to be aware that MS Paint does not support transparency.
This won't matter if you're making textures for the side of nodes,
but generally you need transparency for craft items, etc.

## Editing in GIMP

GIMP is commonly used in the Minetest community. It has quite a high
learning curve as lots of its features are hidden away.

### Use the pencil tool to edit individual pixels

## Common Mistakes

### Blurred textures through usage of incorrect tools

For the most part, you want to manipulate pixels on an individual basis.
The tool for this in most editors is the pencil tool.
