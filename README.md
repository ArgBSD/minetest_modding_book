Minetest Doc
============

This online book will teach you how to create mods in easy chapters.//
The chapters will explain a concept, give examples, and set tasks for you to complete.

This documentation was created by the Minetest community in order to//
help new modders gain a foothold.

You can contribute to this project on GitHub.//
It uses Jekyll to turn Markdown into a website.

Contributing
------------

You don't need to run jekyll, you can just edit and create files in//
chapters/. In fact, you don't even need to do markdown, send me a word document//
and I can convert it into the correct formatting. It is the writing which is the hard//
bit, not the formatting.

Running as a Website
--------------------

You can build it as a website using jekyll.

**Serving on http://localhost:4000/**

```
$ jekyll serve -b /minetest_doc
```

**Building to folder**

```
$ jekyll build
```

Goes to _site/

Commits
-------

If you are editing or creating a particular chapter, then use commit messages like this:

```
Getting Started - corrected typos
Entities - created chapter
```

Just use a normal style commit message otherwise.
