Minetest uses Lua scripts to provide modding support.
This online book aims to teach you how to create your own mods, starting from the basics.

### What you will need

* A Code Editor. Talked about in the [Lua Scripts](chapters/lua.html#tools) chapter.
* A copy of Minetest in the 0.4 series. (eg: 0.4.11)
* The ability to work independently, without pestering other developers to write you code for you.
* Motivation to continue trying when things go wrong.


### So, go on then.

Start reading. Use the navigation bar on the left to open a chapter.
